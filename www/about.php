                    Nice mobile social network for dog owners. On
            an interactive map displays available walking areas with dogs,
       pet shops, vet clinics and other useful places near you (and with ratings
        users, so you can immediately choose the best). It is possible to do
      on the map and your own notes, warning others about the features or hazards
  route (for example, that doghunters intensified in the area, which, unfortunately, in
 Belarusian cities are not uncommon). The application allows you to upload photos of a pet
(with filters and stickers - everything is as it should be), check in the places you like,
  search and add new friends (with the help of convenient filters - by region or breed),
        to see who is walking nearby, or to invite subscribers for joint walks.
            And Wooof - a full tracker that tracks the duration, mileage,
      pet activity and leading detailed statistics. The application is Russified,
                free and available in the AppStore and GooglePlay.

        border ultrasound), if necessary, includes an alarm mode and allows
         put a signal to the timer. Apply Dog Whistler differently: you can
        to train dogs, to communicate with a pet in a situation when you file
the voice command is impossible, and even, according to the developers, to repel mosquitoes.
     The application is Russified and is available in two versions - free and Pro cost $ 1
                (with expanded functionality and without advertising).
